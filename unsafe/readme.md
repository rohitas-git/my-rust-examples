You can take five actions in unsafe Rust that you canâ€™t in safe Rust, which we call unsafe superpowers. 
Those superpowers include the ability to:

- Dereference a raw pointer
- Call an unsafe function or method
- Access or modify a mutable static variable
- Implement an unsafe trait
- Access fields of unions
